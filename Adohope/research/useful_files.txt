How to read messages ?
There are four tables that you should read from, if you want to list all messages
from who and the date like in iPhone, follow these steps:
	> Read all (chat table) and get the information you need from there.
	> Read (chat_handle_join table) to get the handle ROWID.
	> Read all information you want about the receiver from (handle table).
If you want to list the messages in the chat, then follow these steps:
	> Get chat ROWID.
	> Read (chat_message_join table) to get messages ROWIDs.
	> Read (message table) to get messages and other useful information.

-----


There are three tables we need to look at them.
: chat 
	> ROWID
	> chat_identifier (Replace it with the handle table)
	> Service name (iMessage OR SMS)
	> account_login (x)
	Account login field stores the number that the message sent to (your phone number) OR the email if you are usign iMessage.
	If message received via SMS then it account_login will hold your phone number with a prefix (P:+966XXXXXXXXX). And, if the 
	received message is received via iMessage then, the account_login will hold the email with this format (E:your@email.com).
	> last_read_message_timestamp
	If 0 then it means it never been read. Else, the timestamp of the last read time.
: message
	> ROWID
	> text << the message
	> handle_id
	> is_read (0,1)
	> is_sent (0,1)
	> is_empty (0,1)
	> is_from_me (0,1)
	> date_delivered (0, timestamp)
	> date_read(0, timestamp)
	> date
: chat_message_join
	> chat_id
	> message_id
	> message_date (same as `message` table in  `date` field)
: chat_handle_join
	> caht_id
	> handle_id
: handle
	> ROWID
	> id << number or name
	> service (SMS or iMessage)
	> uncanonicalized_id (Name or phone or null)
